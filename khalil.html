    <p>It’s with a heavy heart that we pay tribute to our team’s most memorable president, most passionate teammate, most respected mentor, most talented driver, and most beloved friend. Khalil had an intense zeal for life and love for others that few possess. His life philosophy is summed up in one of his favorite quotes: “Sing like no one’s listening, love like you’ve never been hurt, dance like nobody’s watching, and live like it’s heaven on earth.” Few have the courage to do any of these; let alone all of them, each and every day. That’s what made Khalil so special and allowed him to have such an enormous impact on so many people.</p>

<p>Khalil gave everyone and everything he did 110% all the time. He always found the energy to be caring, respectful, encouraging, honest, open, charming and funny all at the same time; that’s just who he was. He had a gift for being able to make everyone around him laugh and feel special. It’s rare for talent and humility to co-exist, yet Khalil truly had a lot of both.</p>

<p>Khalil passed away while doing what he loved: racing. If he had to go, he would have wanted it no other way. And he would not have wanted his family or friends to spend their time mourning his loss, but rather to get out and live life to the fullest. In his encouraging tone and with his characteristic smile he would have said, “Find what excites you and do it; don’t wait!”</p>

<p>Khalil created wonderful memories with our SAE team, or more appropriately, our SAE family, since that’s how Khalil always made it feel. He had an unusual charisma that motivated and entertained, he was never afraid of hard work and he was able to focus on something until it was just right. Our great friend will certainly be missed and although his love for life is unmatchable, his memory will live on in our hearts forever.</p>

<p>Thank you Khalil for touching our lives so deeply, for caring so much about everyone around you, and for teaching us to cherish every moment by living passionately and without regret.</p>

<p><br>All our Love,
<br><br>Your UF SAE Family</p>
